# Component
The `CardDefaultContent` is a block used to display all the default text. It has two custom attributes. The `title` is the heading info, passed to its `CardTitle` component. The `text` is used in the `CardText`.

As opposed to the `CardCityContent`, this component doesn't have any animations.
