# Component
The `CardDescription` component doesn't have any custom attributes. It is just a simple styled heading element. A gray background was added in this preview because the component has white text by default.


## Modifiers
There is a handful of utility modifiers available for this component. The `--grow` is used to let the component occupy all the empty space in a flex display. The `--zero-height` makes the component occupy no space, it is used as a starting state for the animations. The `--zero-opacity` modifier makes the component transparent and it is also used for the animations.
