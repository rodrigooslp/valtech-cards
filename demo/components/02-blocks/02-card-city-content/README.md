# Component
The `CardCityContent` is a block used to display all the city text. It has three custom attributes. The `title` and `subtitle` are the heading info, passed to its `CardCityHeader` component. The `text` is used in the `CardDescription`.

All animations in this component are made with [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/). It is easy to use, performant and quite powerful.
