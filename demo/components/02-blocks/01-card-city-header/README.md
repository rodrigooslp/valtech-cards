# Component
The `CardCityHeader` component is a block made by a `CardTitle` and a `CardSubtitle`. It has two custom attributes. It just passes them internally to its children.

The `title` attribute is the value passed to the `CardTitle` and the `subtitle` attribute is sent to the `CardSubtitle` A gray background was added in this preview because the component has white text by default.
