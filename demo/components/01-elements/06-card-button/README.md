# Component
The `CardButton` component doesn't have any custom attributes. It is just a simple styled button element. A gray background was added in this preview because the component has white text, white border and a transparent background.

## Modifiers
There is a handful of utility modifiers available for this component. The `--position-bottom` is used to absolutely position the component to the bottom relative to his parent. The `--invisible` hides the component, it is used as a starting state for the animations. The `--zero-opacity` modifier makes the component transparent and it is also used for the animations.
