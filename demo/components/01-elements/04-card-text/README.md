# Component
The `CardText` component doesn't have any custom attributes. It is just a simple styled heading element. A gray background was added in this preview because the component has white text by default.

It might look similar to the `CardDescription` at first glance, but it has slightly different spacing, colors and is not used in the animations. And it doesn't have any modifiers.
